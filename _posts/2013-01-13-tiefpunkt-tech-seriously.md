Yup, seriously. I didn’t want to mix my personal stuff with so much tech-related posts, yet I feel I want to write more of that stuff. I also wanted to document the software and hardware hacking I do in English as well, so this will be the new platform for that. I hope you like it.

There’s going to be a lot of text, and not nearly as many pictures as on my personal blog. I’m sure you can handle it.
