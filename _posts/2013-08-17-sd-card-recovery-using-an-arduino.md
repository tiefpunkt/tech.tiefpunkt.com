One of my SD card "died" the other day. More specifically, my laptop wouldn't read it anymore, and neither would any other machines or cameras I tried. It did react (looking at the dmesg output), but would only throw errors, and not recognize any partitons on the card. So I decided to try and read it using an Arduino.

All software mentioned here is either included in your Arduino IDE (the CardInfo sketch), or available on [Github](https://github.com/tiefpunkt/arduino_sd_recovery). Feel free to check out some of my other stuff there as well.

### Background

**Attention**: _Dangerous half knowledge ahead_

SD cards have two modes in which they can be accessed. One is the SDIO SD bus mode\*, which is used by your average card reader, your camera, etc. It's fast, and somewhat complicated. The other mode is SPI mode. It's much slower, but it's fairly simple. That's what you use if you connect your SD card to a microcontroller such as an arduino.

### Hardware

[![IMG_0728](/images/IMG_0728-500x375.jpg)](/images/IMG_0728.jpg)

I used a Playduino One Arduino clone (Duemilanove compatible), that I had lying around, and a SD card shield I got from ElectroDragon. Just plugged them together, and ready is your own card reader hardware. I tried it with an Arduino Leonard clone as well, but that did not work. I guess that might be due to a different SPI pin setup, but I didn't investigate further, and instead just went straight for the Playduino.

### Software

I took 3 steps in the recovery process: Grabing the card information using

#### CardInfo

The SD card library in the Arduino IDE contains an example called¬†``CardInfo``. It connects to the card, and gets information such as size, filesystem type, and a list of files on the card.

[![IMG_0732](/images/IMG_0732-500x375.jpg)](/images/IMG_0732.jpg)

That worked, so I kept going.

#### sd_recovery_files

The sketch¬†``sd_recovery_files.ino`` tries to iterate over the filesystem, and outputs all files in a HEX encoded format over the serial port. If you save the output to a file on your machine, you can then parse the file using the supplied python script ``parse_files.py``.

[![IMG_0733](/images/IMG_0733-500x375.jpg)](/images/IMG_0733.jpg)

This surprisingly worked for a number of files, but the¬†``openNextFile()`` function doesn't seem to work all that well, so not all files were copied.

#### sd_recovery_raw

The sketch ``sd_recovery_raw.ino`` reads the SD card block by block, and outputs it in a HEX encoded format over the serial port. You can parse tduemillanovehe output back into a binary file using the supplied¬†``parse_raw.py`` python script.

This may just take forever, and I have not been successful in using that file, but I have yet to actually copy the entire SD card that way (might take a few days for the 4GB card I have).

I tried sending binary data directly over the serial port, which would have made the entire process much quicker, but that did not work at all.

### Conclusion

[![Screenshot - 08162013 - 01:51:37 AM](/images/Screenshot-08162013-015137-AM-500x361.png)](/images/Screenshot-08162013-015137-AM.png)

So even if no "normal" device reads an SD card anymore, all is not lost. Apparently, the SDIO SD bus interface\* can jump the sharks, without breaking the SPI interface completely. I still managed to get some of my data back, even though the stuff I was interested most in getting back seems gone. I could try to do a full backup of the card using my Arduino card reader, but that would take forever (I estimated about 4 days), since I'm transferring at least twice the necessary amount of data (thanks to the HEX encoding) over a 115200 baud serial line. Now my pictures weren't that important.

Again, if you want to try it for yourself, grab an SD card shield and an Arduino, grab the firmware from my [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/tiefpunkt/arduino_sd_recovery), and give it a shot. Feel free to make adjustments to the code, I'd be glad to try it out.

	Very cool work.
	<br>
	Do you think it would be possible to reverse the flow and use the SPI port with a microcontroller to push images on to the SD card?
	<br>
	Combine that with a tiny wireless controller (ElectricImp perhaps) and you could turn any SD card digital picture frame into one that could add pictures from the internet. Just a thought.

		Sure that‚Äôs possible. Depending on the size of the image, that‚Äôll take some time, but the library allows you to both read from and write to the SD card. There are a few examples included with the Arduino IDE, just take a look at them, they‚Äôll usually get you pretty far.

* Kevin Osborn says 19. August 2013 at 18:50
	<blockquote>
	The openNextFile() problem you mentioned is because you keep allocating new File objects and never close them. If you use just one, and close it after each file, you should be fine. This was also an error in one of the library examples, which I reported, and I think it was fixed, but I haven‚Äôt verified.
	</blockquote>

	* tiefpunkt says 19. August 2013 at 22:29
		<blockquote>
		So you mean I use up all the memory on the ATmega, by not closing the File objects? Haven‚Äôt thought of that, but it makes a lot of sense.
		But what would be the best way to take care of that then? Have a second variable, assign the returning object from openNextFile() to that, and then close the first?

	Hope Kevin answers that
	<br>
	What I want to do is fix the card . They used to cost hundreds and frequently give up.
	Anyone know how to do that?
	Ive got 6 stored

	For higher speed you could use an ethernet shield, which by the way comes with a micro sd reader, or an wireless shield.

		Thought about using a RPi instead next time, since it also has SPI. That might give even more performance.

	I had the same problem with my SD card and I bought the same hardware(UNO+SD shield from electrodragon). I thought SD was dead but suddenly cardinfo read the card! My problem now is that when i use parse_files my console freezes‚Ä¶ Maybe it‚Äôs the problem that you don‚Äôt close files and Atmega can‚Äôt handle it? I don‚Äôt know I‚Äôam new with this but now that I found sd isn‚Äôt dead I really want to bring back the photos but I can‚Äôt..

	Finally I recovered my photos from SD by binary stream and not HEX. Binary is way faster and does the job easier. No need 2nd program to convert HEX to photo.

	I successfully copied a jpg file from an SD card via SPI to computer and displayed the image.

	However, there are caveats. üôÇ
	<br><br>
	‚Äì ran it on Linux IDE<br>

	Editing the hex was necessary to remove header/trailer messages like ‚ÄúTerminal ready‚Äù which either come across the serial interface or are inserted by picocom. The header and trailer are constant strings, so not hard to remove ‚Ä¶ I just hate the kluge. Should be able to write some python to automate, if I can‚Äôt find a setting to avoid.
	<br><br>
	This approach only works one file at a time. But, could be used to rescue individual important files.

	I have some other ideas ‚Ä¶ a little success encourages me to proceed.
