Hi! I'm Severin, hacker, maker, all-round nerd based in Munich, Germany.

This is a place for me to post some of my endevours that don't necessarily fit anywhere else and deserve a little bit of text. You can find more of my work in numerous places, like [GitHub](github.com/tiefpunkt/), [hackaday.io](https://hackaday.io/tiefpunkt), at [MakerVan Labs](https://wiki.makervan.de/) or the [project section of my website](https://severin.schols.de/projects/).

If you found something that helped you, consider [buying me a coffee](https://ko-fi.com/tiefpunkt).
